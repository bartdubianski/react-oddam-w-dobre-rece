# Oddam w Dobre RÄ™ce
*Project currently in progress*

## Aim of the project
Main task of this project is to recreate a website based on the .xd layout mockup created by Magda - a Coders Lab UI/UX course student.
Tha main idea behind the website is to create a place where everyone can donate personal belongings that are no longer needed at home to verified charities.
The project should be a **desktop website** (mobile version is not in scope of this project) with a simple form which would help the user with the donation process.

## Main assumptions:
- creation of the desktop web view as per the mockup provided
- working form with validation
- data saved in JSON or in another database
- user login and registration + logout functionalities
- form accessible only to authenticated user's

## Technology I chose to complete the project:
- React Router
- React Scroll
- Sass
- Google Firebase
